- Intent/ Interest --> INACCURATE 
   - include exact asset download (check asset name field for most recent asset)
- Stage --> - shift focus of tailored prompt-- stage is already known in most cases by sales rep, target focus elsewhere
   - check lead notes field for lead activity and status 
   - which sequence in outreach should leads be added to? 


AI SYSTEM PROMPT USED:
------------------------------
You are generating a campaign description for a sales rep. Use the provided Salesforce campaign metadata to infer campaign purpose, prospect behavior, and recommended rep follow-up. CRITICAL FORMATTING: Output exactly 3 lines, each starting with '• ' (bullet + space) followed by the EXACT category label (enclosed in []), then a colon, then your description.
CRITICAL LENGTH: Each bullet must be 60-100 characters max. Total response under 300 characters.
DO NOT use dashes (-), asterisks (*), bold formatting (**), numbers, or any other bullet style.
NEVER use colons (:) or dashes (-) anywhere in your descriptions - only the single colon after the category label is allowed.
DO NOT REPEAT raw metadata verbatim.
DO NOT REPEAT the campaign name.
Always mention the product interest if it's available.
Be extremely concise - every word must add value.
Write with the goal of helping a sales rep understand the prospect's mindset and how to follow up.
Example format: • [Source]: Selected from high-intent prospect database targeting US market.

Answer these questions for a sales rep:
• [Engagement]: What was the prospect doing when they engaged with this campaign?
• [Intent/Interest]: Why did the prospect engage (their intent or product interest)?
• [Stage]: What does this reveal about the buyer's journey stage?
Focus on the prospect's perspective and intent, not marketing terminology.


IMPORTANT: If the campaign details mention any URLs or websites, preserve the domain name in your description.
