## **Project 2– [SFDC Campaign Clarity Enhancement](https://github.com/meganfung38/SFDC_Campaign_Clarity.git)** 

### **What are SFDC Campaigns?** 

* SFDC campaigns are used to track marketing touchpoints:   
  * Sponsored links   
  * Ads   
  * Outreach efforts   
* Sales reps can tag themselves to campaign records to receive credit for their influence on a lead or opportunity

### **Problem Statement** 

* There is a large volume of campaigns in SFDC that are vaguely described   
* Sales reps often do not know what individual campaigns represent, leading to:   
  * Tagging confusion or avoidance   
  * Under attribution of rep influence   
  * Lower data trust in campaign reporting 

### **Solution** 

* Use AI to clean up and clarify campaign metadata (especially descriptions)   
* Enable reps to quickly understand what a campaign represents so they can confidently tag their influence and use campaign data effectively   
* Transform technical marketing campaign data into actionable sales insights to help sales understand prospect behavior and tailor their approach accordingly. This enhancement is essential for sales enablement, bridging the gap between marketing campaigns and sales conversations   
* Input– campaigns from last 12 months with recent members   
* Output– excel reports with AI generated campaign descriptions   
* Steps:   
1. Campaign Metadata Collection   
* Pull active campaign records from SFDC– campaigns with CampaignMember(s) created in the last year  
  * CampaignMember– anyone who engaged with a marketing campaign (SFDC objects: Lead, Contact, Account)   
* Query campaign data for each active campaign: 

| Field | Description |
| :---- | :---- |
| Channel\_\_c  | Engagement method  |
| Integrated\_Marketing\_\_c | Cross channel marketing integration indicator |
| Intended\_Product\_\_c  | Product interest  |
| Sub\_Channel\_\_c | Secondary channel |
| Sub\_Channel\_Detail\_\_c | Specific engagement context  |
| TCP\_Campaign\_\_c  | Target customer profile campaign identifier |
| TCP\_Program\_\_c  | Target customer profile program classification |
| TCP\_Theme\_\_c  | Target customer profile and strategy |
| Type  | Campaign format |
| Vendor\_\_c  | Lead source context  |
| Vertical\_\_c | Industry context |
| Marketing\_Message\_\_c | Value proposition focus  |
| Territory\_\_c  | Sales territory assignment |
| Description | Campaign description |
| BMID\_\_c | Business marketing ID |
| Id | Campaign identifier  |
| Name | Campaign title |
| Intended\_Country\_\_c | Target geographic market for campaign |
| Non\_Attributable\_\_c | Attribution tracking True– Cannot directly trace leads back to this campaign (lead may have been influenced by campaign) False– Can clearly track that a lead came from this specific campaign (clear cause \+ effect) |
| Program\_\_c  | Parent marketing program |
| Short\_Description\_for\_Sales\_\_c | Concise sales focused campaign summary (TO IMPROVE)  |

2. Problem Analysis \+ Campaign Contextual Enrichment  
* Context enrichment: transform raw SFDC data into human readable context using [field mappings](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Z0iVJkz1h0ruPdTsoHWYa2bdpqLAZ643Z3UMoWWFKgg/edit?usp=sharing)   
* Channel analysis: determine campaign channel and what it reveals


3. AI Driven Enhancement  
* Send enriched marketing data to openai to generate sales friendly descriptions targeting  
* Base Prompt: You are generating a campaign description for a sales rep. Use the provided Salesforce campaign metadata to infer campaign purpose, prospect behavior, and recommended rep follow-up.   
  * CRITICAL FORMATTING: Output exactly 3 lines, each starting with ‘• ‘ (bullet \+ space) followed by the EXACT category label (enclosed in \[\]), then a colon, then your description.   
  * DO NOT use dashes (-), asterisks (\*), bold formatting (\*\*), numbers, or any other bullet style.  
  * NEVER use colons (:) or dashes (-) anywhere in your descriptions– only the single colon after the category label is allowed.   
  * Each bullet should use this format: • \<Exact Category Label\>: \<Your Description\>  
  * DO NOT REPEAT raw metadata verbatim.  
  * DO NOT repeat the campaign name.  
  * Descriptions should be clear, relevant, quick to read, and under 255 characters total.   
  * Always mention the product interest if it’s available.   
  * Write with the goal of helping a sales rep understand the prospect’s mindset and how to follow up.   
  * Each bullet should use this format: • \<Exact Category Label\>: \<Your Description\>

### **Questions**

* Which SFDC fields provide the most meaningful context for understanding campaign intent?

* What are the strategic goals behind enhancing campaign descriptions?   
  * Who is the intended audience? Just sales reps?

* Should I have tailored prompts for specific field values?   
  * For instance, I currently have two separate prompts for:
