DO NOT use dashes (-), asterisks (*), bold formatting (**), numbers, or any other bullet style.
NEVER use colons (:) or dashes (-) anywhere in your descriptions - only the single colon after the category label is allowed.

Example format: • [Source]: Selected from high-intent prospect database targeting US market.
PRIORITIZE information from the Campaign description, Concise sales focused campaign summary, and Business Marketing ID fields.
